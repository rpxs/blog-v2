}

I recently got the chance to talk to [Jake Cooper](https://twitter.com/JustJake), founder of [Railway](https://railway.app), a fairly new IaaS provider. We talked about how and why Railway was founded, it's current state, and it's future.

**Jack: All right. To start off, can you just tell us like a little bit of generic information, like your name, what you do, and any hobbies you have?**

**Jake:** So my name is Jake Cooper. I am 26 years old now. I run a company called Railway. In my spare time, I play a bunch of video games. I read some books, I hang out with my lizard, hang with my roommates. I'm from a small town called Nanaimo on Vancouver Island up in Canada. Now I live in and work in San Francisco.

**Jack: So what was the big motivator for you to found Railway?**

**Jake:** I just thought that everything needed to be a lot easier. So I started Railway after I left Uber. And I was like, looking for the next thing I wanted to work on, I knew it was software infrastructure. I knew I wanted to hack on a few different things. So I built this crappy little script that basically just dumped a bunch of Postgres instances on a VM. So whenever I needed anything else, I just pulled a Postgres instance, I would just have access to it. Then I would use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to go build and deploy all my stuff, right. I'd always loved Vercel, and the Heroku experience, but it did never really seem to extend it well to databases. So there was always this huge hole.

So I went and asked Vercel like, "Hey, are you guys wanting to build this?", and they said, No, we don't really want to go and build that. I was like, okay, and then when asked a few other people, I thought [Prisma](https://prisma.io) would be doing a hosted cloud version. But Johannes from Prisma said, "No, we don't want to actually do the database stuff, we just want to do the layer in between the application layer and database.", So I was like, "Shit, doesn't look like anybody's building this!", I went to a few other people, I went to talk to GitHub, and I was like "Oh, yeah, you guys have the code layer, you have Azure, you might be wanting to do this right?.", but then they said no. So then I was like, "Fuck, I guess I'm gonna have to build this myself, right?", because I was just hacking a bunch of things, and I wasn't really hyped on anything. But I was constantly going back and editing this provisioning engine. Because I wanted to be able to deploy arbitrary application code, etc. Then it just ended up that the thing worked, and then I was sharing it with a few friends. So that's kind of just how it got started.

**Jack: Wow, so what made you want to go into the tech industry in the first place?**

**Jake:** Yeah, so I was always a pretty dorky kid, and I was constantly fiddling with a bunch of stuff. I actually started in hobbyist electrical engineering, so I was building portable Nintendo 64. I briefly wrote some hacks for video games in C++. So I guess, the core of getting into tech was building portable Nintendo 64's, and I actually ended up on Palmer Luckey's old forums, and I was working on these forums. I was also writing a bit of code on the side, because I was trading Team Fortress Two hats, and I made something for visualizing people's backpacks. So I was just constantly using coding or tech as this tool to just do the things that I wanted to do. So I worked on those things for a little while. Then I think it was, 15, or 16, at the time when I was doing that.

Afterwards I went to college, and I was like, cool, I'm gonna go do electrical engineering, that sounds really sweet. I got to college and I realized that, if you want to do electrical engineering, you need a bunch of grants, and it takes a really long time. And there was no good way to print CPUs or anything like that at the time, or print boards. So it was constantly this big, I want to say like bullshit exercise, and designing a bunch of stuff on these really long feedback loops. So then I thought, well, this kind of, I don't wanna say it sucks because, it's really still really, really cool, but it's not fast enough, right? It's been like one of those people that's like, I really need to see my thing because that's what fills my gas tank and motivates me.

So I was like, how do you make this process quicker, because I just can't see myself working for an electrical engineering job. Since I have to do a lot of random stuff and then you know, it takes a while to machine these things. And then I might fuck something up. There's a whole assembly line, and code is just a lot quicker, right? So I switched out of electrical engineering into software engineering, and ended up graduating with an amalgam of these electrical engineering and software engineering courses. And they were like, Yeah, fuck it, here's a software engineering degree. And then yeah, I was just like, okay, cool, so I'm gonna go do some engineering stuff. And then that led to my first job. I was working for Wolfram part time while I was in college near the end, and then I just kind of rolled through a few jobs. I worked at Bloomberg, I worked at Uber, and then I started Railway.

**Jack: Back to previous jobs, did you leave Uber to start Railway, or was there another reason?**

**Jake:** So I got to Uber, because a friend was like, "Hey, we just bought this company called Jump, which does electric bikes and scooters." I really, really always loved the idea of electrical transport, as well as non car mechanisms to get around, right? I just think cars are this enormous waste of space, and it's so tragic. But at the same time, I understand why, you know, people don't really want to get on a crowded bus or anything like that. I think, honestly, like, trains are a really good way to get around, and I don't know why more people don't use them. But anyways, I was like, cool, sustainable electric transport. Subsidized by this large company, you know, they're gonna lose a bunch of money, etc. But, I get to work on these cool problems. And they told me, "Hey, we have this really shitty Rails app. It needs to be Uber scale. So you have to go in and build all the distributed systems for it. Do you find this interesting?" So I was like, cool!

So I went there, and then I joined Jump. So we were on a team of, I don't know, maybe six people for like, building out the core backend system. So we built this really awesome system, and it was going great. We had a lot of people using it, I went to San Diego, I ended up going to Paris to launch a third party scooter integration. But then, Uber just axed the whole program, because they were going to, I guess, become a sustainable company and not lose a bunch of money, which, you know, fair play. So then they axed the thing, and then there was this kind of tension in the air. I guess it's like a calm before the storm, and you can usually tell when, when shit isn't going right. So I basically asked my manager, I was like, "Hey, man, so you know, if you're, hypothetically going to lay people off, you know, I'm 25. I'm kind of done with this. If you guys are going to shelve the whole thing, if you got to fire somebody fire me." So they ended up like a few weeks later firing, I think, like a third of the people. Then they kept a third of them on to like, go and transition a bunch of the stuff over the line, and I think they kept the last third of the people and just moved them to other parts of Uber. But I was like, cool, I'm done with Jump, so what do I want to do next? Then I was just like, you know, hacking on a few things, and I just came back to that infrastructure provisioning engine. and that ended up being Railway. Yeah, I had no aim. I was just kind of, trying to figure out what to do. Then I just started writing a bit of code for spinning up these databases after I left, so yeah, that's more of why I moved into Railway.

**Jack: Railway is one of the only truly free IaaS providers. Do you think you guys are gaining or losing money by providing these resources for free?**

**Jake:** Oh, we are we are 100% losing money! Absolutely, without a doubt. Even just in this initial interim stage, we're losing a nice chunk of money, like five figures a month probably. I mean, it's more like a low five figures per month in terms of free plan costs. But I think providing accessible infrastructure for users is really, really key. Because then people just start using the thing, right? There's no mechanism for people to try it out, if you don't have a free plan. So, I think it's really, really powerful. There's two unit step functions, essentially, you go from the hobbyists who are just pedaling on their projects, etc, paying anywhere from zero to eight bucks a month or something like that, because they just wanna host some random stuff. Then you do a unit step function, where you go from those hobbyists to the startups, right? And then that gets you into a little bit more meaty territory where people are paying, let's say on the order of hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars per month, right? Then you have another one where basically you go from startups to enterprises where people start paying six or seven figures a month.

But if you try and monetize that lower end of the spectrum, it's not really where the money kind of is long term. But it is where the interest is. You can think of the free plan as kind of like a marketing and R&D kind of thing where, you know, we are definitely gonna lose money on that. But I think it's really important to help provide that, because firstly, it'll help you grow the platform in terms of scaling. Second, it'll help you actually market the platform to the point where people say, "Okay, cool. This is actually really, really neat!" Three, it will also just help you buff out any sort of like issues, problems, etc. Because people will just come to you with with problems, and hilariously enough, it's almost always the people on the free plan who will have the highest standard for complaints. Then, you know, you go to these enterprise people who are paying you, I dunno, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, and they're just like, "Yeah, this is great! We don't really have any complaints."

So you can honestly, get really, really good feedback from those people who are on these free plans, because for some reason, I have no idea what it is, they'll just tell you everything! They'll just, tell you all of these things as of, what could be better? Or what their their issues are, etc. They're just, very, very forthcoming of it. So to answer your question, I mean, we're definitely used to losing money, but it's one of those things where, I think, to build a large cloud business, it's not cheap. It's just gonna cost a lot of money over the long term to build a large cloud business, period.

**Jack: All right. So do you think you're facing a lot of competition from other cloud hosting providers like Heroku, Digital Ocean, and Render?**

**Jake:** I think if you look at the business as it stands right now, then yes, you would say probably, but, I was talking to one of our engineers today about this. It's like, we are competing on our cloud offering right now. But we have this inordinately large roadmap of things we want to build on top of the core stuff that we needed to build infrastructure company. So the version you see of Railway right now is actually just not going to be what Railway looks like in the next two years, it will probably look almost entirely different. We already have a few things that we're going to be rolling out in the next little while, that showcase how we believe people should be building software and how we believe people should be networking infrastructure, and how we believe that people should evolve their system over time.

We're competing with companies like Render which are really, really great. By the way, I have a vast admiration for these people that are building tools that make everything a lot easier to use. I think, regardless of what happens over the next five years, developer tooling is gonna get a lot less shitty, which I'm stoked about, regardless of the size of a successful company. Obviously, we want this company to be very, very large, we obviously want it to succeed. But the end goal, is just to make it easier for everybody to build, ship, and deploy stuff, right? So I would say, yes, it does look competitive, and you know, you're seeing more and more people pop up every day in the landscape. But what we're doing and what we're trying to do here is inherently a very, very hard problem on a very, pin sized dot that we're trying to hit. We're basically trying to hit the perfect abstraction, the perfect level of infrastructure orchestration. It's very hard, so I think it's gonna come down to us competing with ourselves and just building out the best platform that we can. Ultimately, that will come down to everybody else who is trying to hit this golden abstraction, or "The Holy Grail of Infrastructure".

**Jack: In general, what do you think the biggest risk is for Railway right now?**

**Jake:** I'd say the biggest risk for Railway is probably an economic recession, where we couldn't burn a ton of money. Because again, I think it just costs a lot of money to build software like this. You're basically doing supply cost optimization on a bin packing problem for this. But you can grind those numbers out over time, and you can get extremely efficient with them. So that's not like, totally of a concern, you see that with Uber, for example, And despite Uber not having flipped, yet, there's a pretty large consensus in the market that at some point, Uber will be able to monetize this kind of supply and demand structure. I think it's very, very similar to how you're going to see cost optimization in in terms of cloud stuff. So that one doesn't concern me too much. But there's this hump, there's this inordinately large amount of money that you need to spend to be competitive in the cloud landscape, and for you to build the infrastructure to get there, right. So there's almost some sort of activation function, where you're in this trough of losing a bunch of money, you're building out the core infrastructure, anything like this. If we get into an economic slump, where we can't, burn that money to go build those things, then the dream could die very quickly. There's a potential for this company to be extremely large, and that's, one of the large reasons I'm working on this, because I think this can be an extremely large company on the order of like, hundreds of billions to a trillion dollars. Because, I think it's really important to build on something that can be bigger than yourself, and I think to get there, it just takes that outrageous amount of money. It just takes a lot of money, and even what you're seeing right now, like for example, I think GCP is actually losing money on their cloud offering, I think it'd be AWS as the only one who has managed to, like monetize at least on a huge scale. So I think that's probably the biggest risk, because on the on the tech side, we seem to be doing relatively solid.

**Jack: Right now the investor market is full of sharks, did you find it easy or difficult to raise funding for Railway?**

**Jake:** I think it's really easy to raise money if you have a really solid product. Or if you have like a good pedigree. I also think it's really hard to raise money if you're not ex Uber or ex [whatever]. So I think right now, it's a really weird time in the market, especially because of the fact that COVID investors are kind of doubling down on, on the startups that are going really, really well. And they're very, very apprehensive to fund or meet new people. I don't know if that's necessarily true, just looking back on those days, and I said that, because our most recent investor, I haven't even met them yet. I'm going out tomorrow evening with them for the first time for dinner. So yeah, it wasn't too hard to raise money, but I think the initial rounds here are going to be relatively, I don't wanna say easier, but a little bit simpler in terms of actually raising money, because I think the seed stage right now is like, very, very frothy. Plus I think, once you get to that Series A, Series B territory, I think people start to ask a lot more questions. And they say, "Okay, so you've been justifying these multiples so far on a lot of hype, but like, at some point, your business needs to become a business, right?" We're acutely aware of that, and so we were developing out our core business, and we're a seed stage company right now. We'll probably do our Series A in 12 to 18 months, despite us having like, almost four years of runway right now. But really, I was in and out of the fundraising process in two weeks.

**Jack: Do you find working in a small team to be beneficial at Railway?**

**Jake:** So right now the team is actually five people and we've only recently started hiring a little bit more. So I would hazard on the very small team side. My immediate team at Uber was six engineers. The whole jump team was about 50 people. Uber was just a shitload of people. So yeah, I've always tended to go towards smaller, more compartmentalized teams. I very briefly worked at Bloomberg in New York, and it was just such a large entity. It was a difficult engineering culture, because I don't think they really had a ton of autonomy. Whereas, when you're a smaller team, you're forced to have this autonomy. I keep trying to drill into the engineer's heads since we need to be able to step up to these things that we don't necessarily feel like we're qualified to do, because there's quite literally nobody else to do them. Plus, I always tend towards smaller teams, because I think it's where you learn the most. You're given responsibility, not because like people necessarily think you can 100% handle it, but because they're 90% sure, you can handle it, and also just, "Who else is going to handle this?" So yeah, I think working in smaller teams is a lot better. But there's something to be said about working at larger companies with really good standards. For example, we write design docs at Railway, and that was something that I learned at Uber, like laying out your thought processes, etc. So I think there's benefits and drawbacks to working at each of them. But I think if you're looking for the best way to accelerate your learning with a good foundation, you should be working at a smaller company.

**Jack: Was it beneficial to get a company like Railway up and running during a pandemic of such magnitude?**

**Jake:** I think it was really, really beneficial, because there was pretty much nothing else to do. So I wasn't constantly saying, "I really want to take a vacation to Europe" or "I really want to go do whatever." But as a side note, I've tried to do pretty much everything else I wanted in my life before, starting Railway so that I didn't feel like that. But because of the pandemic, there was literally nothing [to do]. It was like, "Okay, well, I can't go back and visit my family. I can't go on vacation. Really, really, all I can do is like go and like go for runs. workout. do kind of like all the things that would like keep me healthy, etc." Then just build a business. So I think it was probably one of the best times to be building a business if I'm being honest.

**Jack: Nice! Do you have any advice for someone trying to get a tech startup running?**

**Jake:** Just try and do a thing that you really think is something that somebody needs or is valuable. I see lots of people that like to come out and be like, "Oh, yeah, I want to be a founder, I want to be whatever." All I can really say to that is, why? There's so many headaches, and there's so much responsibility. Most of these things go to zero, most of these things don't work out. Most of these things, even the ones that like look really, really good, sometimes they just explode for a variety of reasons. I could honestly say that, if you were trying to maximize expected value for your life, what you should go do is you should go into like investment banking, or work at Facebook. Because you're going to learn a lot, you're going to earn a lot, you're also going to be, really, really solid in terms of like, technical proficiency. And then once you really feel like you want to take a risk because like, I think startup stuff is like, it's, it's really, really fun, etc. But it's mostly risky, and you shouldn't start a startup for the sake of starting a startup, you should really try and solve a problem.

The only reason you should start a startup is if you firmly believe that nobody else is going to solve this problem. Because I think you're gonna see a lot of people like pop up afterwards. When we started working on Railway, I don't think anybody was moving towards what we're moving towards. Now I see a few companies that are kind of scratching the surface of what I think infrastructure could be. Again, there's a high odds that things just don't end up working out. So I think, if you're gonna start a startup, and you know what you want to do, just go and do that.

The second piece of advice is just do the do the thing. Railway basically started because I thought, I'm working on this really, really cool problem. I just posted about it on Twitter, and I was like, this is really, really interesting. Who would I talk to in the infrastructure space, and then people are like, "Oh, I want to see what you're working on!". Even the first version of Railway I showed off, it was one Postgres database with a bunch of tables, and anytime that we needed a new user, we would just create a new table, and then they would have access to it. People were like, "Can I, like, connect to this or whatever?" So I just said, Yeah, I guess so. But then they were like, "Why are these all these tables in here with these usernames?" I was like, "Yeah, well, we're working on it." But that was enough. It was this super shitty thing. Anybody could drop any tables, anybody can do whatever, right? But it was the idea of getting that thing out there that people were like,"Hey, like, this is easy enough to spin up!" Then I kind of worked backwards from first principles. So I guess to summarize, the first thing would be, don't start a startup for the sake of starting a startup, and if you're gonna start a startup, do it immediately. Don't piddle around, just know what you're doing, do the thing and then show it off as quick as possible.

**Jack: So this is the last question, and you don't have to answer, but if a company or someone asked to buy Railway out, do you think your investors or you would be on board with it?**

**Jake:** So we actually had this happen a few weeks ago, and pretty much everybody said no, this is way too early. The investors said no, and I was basically trying to be impartial. I wanted to leave it up to the team. My interest here is to keep this going for as long as possible, like full disclosure, and I really want this to succeed. Not because it'll become a big company, but because I really think that we need a tool like Railway to make shipping and delivering software a lot quicker, because most of the job, when you're a software engineer actually kind of sucks. It's just gluing shit together, it's figuring out stuff in an AWS console, it's just not the programming I fell in love with as a child. The idea here is that we can offer that experience to everybody and be like, okay, let's just take away the bullshit and give the most magic. So when companies come to us, my thing is, there's not really a number that strikes in my head to kill the dream. The only reason I actually brought this to the team was, "Okay, this company is actually pretty in line with what we're doing, I think on the really long time horizon, we actually might be competing with them." But there's still a very, very high chance that they end up choosing their market over the market that we're actually trying to pursue. So all the investors said no, all of our engineers said no, and then I was like, pretty much like, no. But again, I wanted to be impartial, and I want people to feel like they have high agency, right, even when it comes to the sale of the company, right, like people who come in the door, and like, you know, they've been here for a month. They're part of the team, right?

So the answer to summarize is, if we think that we can continue to do the thing that we are already doing and want to keep doing, we could consider it, especially if that buyout would accelerate the vision. For example, look at Oculus. When Oculus was acquired by Facebook, I think their budget for R&D titles was just $5 million a year. When Facebook bought them, I think that budget went up to half a billion dollars a year just for giving developers money to develop on Oculus, right. So that vastly accelerated the way that VR is in the market. So if a company came to us and was like, "Hey, listen, like we can actually, like, vastly speed up the rate at which you guys are iterating, because of X, Y, and Z feature" That would be something that we would consider because like, we're very goal focused, and we want this to succeed as quick as possible, so that we can continue to build really, really cool stuff. All of us have high interest in lots and lots of fields, and Railway happens to be the candy store that has brought us all together. But there are there are plenty of other things that we want to work on, and all of these infinitely deep lakes. Most of these lakes just happen to be like around Railway, but there are a few things I would love to work on, like a brain computer interface. Before I die or whatever. So yeah, I think if there was something that came to us and was like, "We can we can make this happen!", and we were 100% certain or at least 99% certain that they weren't bullshitting us cough Amazon cough, then I would consider it because the end goal is just to make building software easier for everybody.
